        Source Tree Layout
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making a note of the source-tree layout of this framework is very important,
because the layout of the source directory is an essential part of the structure
of the framework.

The list below shows the organization of source directory, and provides
additional information that describes the purpose of each directory.


/app
 
        The directory for the web application (abbreviated: app).
        This directory contains the app's files, such as controllers,
        web page templates and configurations. This is the directory
        in which the app developer will be most busy while developing
        their app.
 
/app/config
    
        This is the directory for all app configurations files.
        The directory contains application configurations.
 
/app/controller
    
        This directory contains all the application controllers.
 
/app/template
    
        This directory contains the template files.
 
/component
 
        This directory contains framework components.
 
/core
    
        This directory contains framework core component.
 
/include
 
        Helpful files used to assist the framework, but are not a part
        of the framework's architecture.
 
/service
 
        Framework services that can be used by the application.
 
/web
 
        Contains the front controller and can contain public files.
