TODO

-- Spell check texts that are displayed, like error messages, http status text, etc.
-- rename $controller to something else; im talking about the $controller variable name, the one that is returned by the router. rename it because it's name is confusing when used along with what is an actual controller.
-- Find out how 404 errors are handled. Apparently, errors are handled by the framework
-- What about an error handler that handles errors like 404? I think I need an error handler to handle that sort of stuff. I also need an error controller than prepares a text and template and renders the error page.
-- System Exception: How does the system report errors? Upon an error, the error is reported via a response. So in essence the system hijacks the response for which the request asked with its own 500-internal-error response. I believe that all system errors must be caught before the server has a chance to responds to the browser's request. This way, system response will take precedence over the server's response to the browser's request.

DONE

-- renamed namespace for most components. let all components sit under the namespace "{FrameworkName}\Component", rather than "{FrameworkName}\Component\{ComponentName}"
-- I think the response and requests should be static as there can only be one request and response per script execution
-- Designed and developed the views
-- Created the route parser in router->search
-- The app routing config now loads properly
