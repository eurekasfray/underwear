NAMING CONVENTION FOR THE FRAMEWORK

Because I like to see names like "Backbone.js" and "Node.js", the name for this framework shall follow the same convention: Name.ext

The intention of this convention is to display the programming language in which the framework was written without having to type an unattractive text like "MVC PHP Framework" next to the name of the framework.


CONCERN

I have a concern that the convention will misleads people to thinking that framework's code is contained within a single file.
