        Error Handling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following for the moment refers to error handling in the scope of the
handling errors returned by functions and routines. For example, when a key is
searched for by a function, the value returned by the function will either
indicate error or success. The question is, how is error or success to be
indicated by the function?

The primary concern for now is this: how do I implement a system of
error/success/warning return values?

The following is a system for error/success/warning return values:

    -- values less than zero indicates error.
    -- values greater than zero indicate success
    -- zero indicates warning
    
In the context of PHP, where return values can be of various (i.e., one function
can return either an integer value, a string or array), will the outcome
indicator be of the same system mentioned above.
