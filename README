Underwear is a prototype of an MVC framework. Created for me to study 
and play with an MVC-type framework, I began developing the framework 
after a skimmed-through study of how the Symfony and Negative(-11) 
frameworks operate. Underwear was designed to be experimental and 
not production-intended being that I know very little about actual 
framework design. So, heed my warning if you plan otherwise.

Underwear is under development.
